abstract={Estimation and inference of treatment effects under unconfounded treatment assignments often suffer from bias and the `curse of dimensionality' due to the nonparametric estimation of nuisance parameters for high-dimensional confounders. Although debiased state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for binary treatments under particular treatment models, they can be unstable for small sample sizes. Moreover, directly extending them to general treatment models can lead to computational complexity. We propose a balanced neural networks weighting method for general treatment models, which leverages deep neural networks to alleviate the curse of dimensionality while retaining optimal covariate balance through calibration, thereby achieving debiased and robust estimation. Our method accommodates a wide range of treatment models, including average, quantile, distributional, and asymmetric least squares treatment effects, for discrete, continuous, and mixed treatments. Under regularity conditions, we show that our estimator achieves rate double robustness and $\sqrt{N}$-asymptotic normality, and its asymptotic variance achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. We further develop a statistical inference procedure based on weighted bootstrap, which avoids estimating the efficient influence/score functions. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing alternatives, especially when the sample size is small. Applications to the 401(k) dataset and the Mother's Significant Features dataset further illustrate the practical value of the method for estimating both average and quantile treatment effects under binary and continuous treatments, respectively.},

title = {Applications of functional dependence to spatial econometrics},

abstract={In this paper, we generalize the concept of functional dependence (FD) from time series (see Wu [2005, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102, 14150–14154]) and stationary random fields (see El Machkouri, Volný, and Wu [2013, Stochastic Processes and Their Applications 123, 1–14]) to nonstationary spatial processes. Within conventional settings in spatial econometrics, we define the concept of spatial FD measure and establish a moment inequality, an exponential inequality, a Nagaev-type inequality, a law of large numbers, and a central limit theorem. We show that the dependent variables generated by some common spatial econometric models, including spatial autoregressive (SAR) models, threshold SAR models, and spatial panel data models, are functionally dependent under regular conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of FD measures under various transformations, which are useful in applications. Moreover, we compare spatial FD with the spatial mixing and spatial near-epoch dependence proposed in Jenish and Prucha ([2009, Journal of Econometrics 150, 86–98], [2012, Journal of Econometrics 170, 178–190]), and we illustrate its advantages. },
